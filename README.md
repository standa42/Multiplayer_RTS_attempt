# Multiplayer_RTS_attempt
- As an old school project for C# language - I tried to create multiplayer RTS for smartphones using Unity and lockstep multiplayer model over Google Play services multiplayer.
- It ended up supporting only movement of units, but the prototype was working - tested on two distant smartphones.
